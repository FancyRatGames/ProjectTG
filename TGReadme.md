Project: TG SDK Made by FancyRat/FancyRatGames
License, how-to and more to help you make a game/mod/project...

1. License:
This project uses an MIT license (https://mit-license.org/)
If it follows the MIT license terms of service and you give partial credit (like in the credits or in the game/mod/project page) then you are able to make profit and publish your own project as the MIT license says...

2. How-To:
This SDK uses Unity Engine as a base and so you will need version 2021.3.12f1 or higher to use it (similar versions of unity like the late 2020 versions still work but it was not made for those versions)
To create something with the SDK you'll need to launch Unity Editor and import the assets that you want to use.
Not all assets are there so don't delete anything, if it asks to replace something then replace it.
You will need basic knowledge of C# and VR game developement, if this is your first project consider to get an expansion pack of P: TG or follow "Valem" tutorials on YouTube.

3. What you can do:
You can basically do any VR game that you want by importing more assets or just using the ones included in the SDK.

4. Expansion packs:
There are some expansion packs that you can get for free or for a cheap price, I'll update this SDK to include links to all the expansion packs.
